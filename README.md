# Used_Car_Price_Prediction

Deployed at:https://ucpp.onrender.com/

This repository contains a web application built with Flask that predicts the price of used cars based on various features. The application uses machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

# How to Execute

To get execute the project, follow the instructions below:

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Create a virtual environment and activate it
- Install the dependencies by running **pip install -r requirements.txt**
- Run the application by executing the command **python app.py**
- Access the application by visiting **http://localhost:5000** in your web browser

# Dataset

This is a modified dataset from kaggle.

Dataset is available in the Jupyter/Dataset directory

- **Raw Dataset Part 1.csv** and **Raw Dataset Part 2.csv** are the required dataset which is splitted into 2 parts
- Proprocessed Dataset is the final dataset used for training.

# Jupyter

- The ML training is done in the **"Jupyter/Used Car Price Prediction.ipynb"** file
- Analytics about the dataset is done in **"Jupyter/Analytics.ipynb"** file
